1. Quantum computers work by exploiting quantum physical effects to decrease the time required to solve (certain) computational problems by creating and utilizing quantum superpositions.

2. This is particularly relevant because most public-key cryptosystems deployed today—including RSA, EC, ElGamal and Difﬁe—Hellman—rely on the computational hardness of either one of these two problems. Blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography and one of the most prominent applications of blockchain are cryptocurrencies. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified blockchain technology as one of its six mega-trends in a new report broadly aimed at outlining the expected transition to a more digital and connected world.

3. Current security is built on conventional cryptography. However, threats to current cryptographic techniques created by major advances in quantum computing are widely acknowledged as both real and forthcoming. Although quantum computers large enough to undertake hacking do not yet exist, retrospective decryption is a very real threat and critical data requiring long-term security should be protected now.
